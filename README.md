# Jarvis-AI-Chatbot

Jarvis is an AI-virtual assistant, just like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. It is a master javascript project that uses the javascript advance concept to help understand jarvis, what the client is asking for, and then providing the web search result to the user. We have just created a prototype for this project as of now, but there is a lot of scope for this project.

Major updates we can add to our project are adding more voice commands, providing datasets, and allowing media uploads, which Jarvis can scan and provide results in reference to our data.

General Questions:

What is a Virtual Assistant?

A virtual assistant is web application software that uses AI and NLP methods for listening to the commands of the user, interpreting them into machine-understandable language using NLP, and then providing the relevant web result.

What laguage is used for the project?

I have used CSS and Javascript for adding the styling and functionality to our jarvis project.

Creating Structure (HTML):

HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is what we will be using for creating the structure for our Jarvis AI virtual assistant. We will be creating a default structure where we will add some media files and a button, which we will be using for providing commands to the virtual assistant using a Javascript function.
